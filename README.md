## Project Details

This is a React project. I trying to make a fundraising website. Website details are given below:
* This Fundraising website is made with React and Bootstrap.
* On this website, interested donors are listed. Here you can select your donor by the "Add to Favorite" button. If you select donors, in the sidebar you can see the total added donors and their total donation amount with their name and photo.
* This is a practice project. That's why all data are fake. Images are collected from [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/). Favicon is collected from [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).
